Analyzing the Gases for proportions of Acetone, Alcohol, Isopropanol using Electronic Nose and Gas Chromatography
The Research was conducted in the University of South Florida laboratory under guidance of Professor Takshi on Electronic Nose by passing normal gas and different proportions of Methanol, Isopropanol and Ethanol and the readings wear recorded. Apparatus Used:
Electronic Nose, Methanol (137 ppm, 164 ppm, 292 ppm), Isopropanol (217 ppm,117 ppm,143 ppm), Ethanol (200 ppm, 123ppm,161 ppm)
Data Collection: The Electronic Nose is exposed to Normal gas and after the values of the Electronic Nose array are stabilized then the Baseline values are Recorded. And the Electronic Nose is exposed to Methanol, Isopropanol and Ethanol gases and the values are recorded once the Electronic Nose Array values started stabilizing. The data was collected multiple times and we tried to Analyze the data collected separately and combined with the old data.
